Troubleshooting PyDev Installation
While setting up an environment to work on python4capella, I encountered difficulties installing PyDev. Below is a summary of the steps I took and the resources I consulted in an attempt to resolve the issue.

Steps Taken and Resources Consulted
PyDev Official Resources:

PyDev Update Sites
PyDev on Eclipse Marketplace
Tutorials and Videos:

YouTube Installation Guide
Online Forums and Q&A Sites:

Stack Overflow: Unable to Load Repository

Encountered Issues
Despite following the guides and troubleshooting steps, I continued to face errors such as "unable to load repository." I attempted several fixes found on various forums but had limited success.

Potential Solution
I discovered a possible solution on Stack Overflow, which suggests downloading PyDev from SourceForge. However, access to SourceForge is currently blocked by Telesat, so I am exploring ways to either gain access or find an alternative installation method.
